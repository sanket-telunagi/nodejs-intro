    - Binary data : 
        - computer stores data in binary format 

    - Character sets :
        - Predefined sets of character represented by numbers 
        - Popular character sets are : 
            1. unicode 
            2. ASCII
        
    - Character Encoding :
        - Dictates how to represent a number in character set as binary data before it can be stored in computer 
        - It dictates how many bits to use to represent the number 
        - Ex : UTF - 8
        - UTF-8 States that charcter should be encoded in bytes (8 bits)

    ```js
    console.log("A".charCodeAt()) ; // 65
    ```

*/

console.log("a".charCodeAt()); // 97
