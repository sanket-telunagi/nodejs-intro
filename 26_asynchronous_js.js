    - javascript is synchronous, blocking, single threaded language 

    - Synchronous :
        - jsvascript waits untill the previous function finishes its job
        - Only one line executing at a time
    
    - blocking :
        - No matter how long the previous process takes, subsequent process is not initialised untill the previous is finished 

    - Single threaded :
        - A thread is a process that javascript program can use to run the task 
        - Each thread can do only one task at a time
        - java script has only one thread called the main thread for executing any time
